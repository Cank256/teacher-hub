## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)

#### 1.1 Incident Detection
**Automated Detection:**
- Monitor receives alert
- Alert includes severity, affected metrics, and initial context
- Automated ticket created in incident management system

**Manual Detection:**
- Reporter creates incident ticket
- Includes description, steps to reproduce, and impact assessment
- Assigns initial severity level

#### 1.2 Initial Triage
**Incident Commander Assignment:**
- P0/P1: Mobile Team Lead or designated on-call
- P2/P3: Available mobile developer

**Initial Assessment Questions:**
1. How many users are affected?
2. What functionality is impacted?
3. Is there a workaround available?
4. Is this a regression from recent changes?
5. Are there any security implications?

#### 1.3 Severity Confirmation
- Review impact scope and user reports
- Confirm or adjust severity level
- Document initial findings

### Phase 2: Response Team Assembly (15-30 minutes)

#### 2.1 Team Mobilization

**P0 Response Team:**
- Incident Commander (Mobile Team Lead)
- Mobile Developer (Primary)
- Mobile Developer (Secondary)
- Backend Developer (if API related)
- DevOps Engineer
- Product Manager
- Customer Support Lead
- Executive Sponsor (CTO/VP Engineering)

**P1 Response Team:**
- Incident Commander
- Mobile Developer (Primary)
- Backend Developer (if needed)
- DevOps Engineer (if needed)
- Product Manager
- Customer Support Representative

**P2/P3 Response Team:**
- Assigned Developer
- Product Manager (notification only)

#### 2.2 Communication Setup
**Primary Channels:**
- Slack: #incident-response-mobile
- Conference Bridge: [Emergency bridge number]
- Incident Tracking: [Incident management tool]

**Communication Protocols:**
- All team members join incident channel
- Status updates every 30 minutes for P0/P1
- Status updates every 2 hours for P2
- Document all actions and decisions

### Phase 3: Investigation and Diagnosis (30 minutes - 2 hours)

#### 3.1 Information Gathering
**Technical Investigation:**
```bash
# Check recent deployments
git log --oneline --since="24 hours ago"

# Review error logs
sentry-cli issues list --query="is:unresolved"

# Check performance metrics
# Review Firebase Analytics dashboard
# Check EAS Build status
```

**User Impact Assessment:**
- Affected user count and demographics
- Geographic distribution of issues
- Device/OS version correlation
- Feature usage impact

#### 3.2 Root Cause Analysis
**Common Investigation Areas:**
1. **Recent Code Changes**
   - Review recent commits and PRs
   - Check for related configuration changes
   - Verify deployment success

2. **Third-Party Dependencies**
   - Check service status pages
   - Verify API integrations
   - Review authentication providers

3. **Infrastructure Issues**
   - Server performance and availability
   - CDN and asset delivery
   - Database performance

4. **Client-Side Issues**
   - Device-specific problems
   - OS version compatibility
   - App store distribution issues

#### 3.3 Impact Scope Definition
- Quantify affected users
- Identify affected features/workflows
- Assess business impact
- Determine urgency for resolution

### Phase 4: Immediate Response Actions (Parallel to Investigation)

#### 4.1 Damage Control

**Kill Switch Activation:**
```typescript
// Disable problematic features immediately
featureFlags.activateKillSwitch('problematic_feature');
featureFlags.activateKillSwitch('related_feature');

// Example kill switches:
- file_upload: Disable if causing crashes
- real_time_messaging: Disable if overloading servers
- offline_sync: Disable if causing data corruption
```

**Traffic Management:**
- Implement rate limiting if needed
- Redirect users to fallback flows
- Display maintenance messages

#### 4.2 User Communication

**P0/P1 Communication Template:**
```
ðŸš¨ Service Alert: We're investigating reports of [issue description]. 
Our team is working on a fix. 

Affected: [feature/functionality]
Workaround: [if available]
Updates: We'll provide updates every 30 minutes

Status page: https://status.teacherhub.ug
```

**Communication Channels:**
- In-app notifications (if app is functional)
- Push notifications
- Social media (Twitter, Facebook)
- Website banner
- Email to affected users (if identifiable)

#### 4.3 Escalation Procedures

**Internal Escalation:**
- P0: Immediate notification to executives
- P1: Notification within 1 hour
- P2: Next business day notification

**External Escalation:**
- App store contact (if needed)
- Third-party vendor escalation
- Legal/compliance notification (if data involved)

### Phase 5: Resolution Implementation (1-4 hours)

#### 5.1 Solution Development

**Hotfix Process:**
```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/incident-[ticket-number]

# Implement minimal fix
# Focus on stopping the bleeding, not perfect solution

# Fast-track testing
npm run test:critical
npm run test:affected-areas

# Deploy via OTA if possible
eas update --branch production --message "Hotfix: [description]"

# Or emergency build if native changes needed
eas build --platform all --profile production --non-interactive
```

**Solution Validation:**
- Test fix in staging environment
- Verify fix addresses root cause
- Ensure no new issues introduced
- Get approval from incident commander

#### 5.2 Deployment Strategy

**OTA Update (Preferred for JS-only fixes):**
- Faster deployment (minutes)
- Immediate rollout to all users
- Easy rollback if issues

**Binary Update (Required for native changes):**
- Longer deployment (hours)
- App store review may be needed
- Staged rollout recommended

**Gradual Rollout:**
```bash
# Start with small percentage
eas update --branch production --rollout 10%

# Monitor for 30 minutes, then increase
eas update --branch production --rollout 50%

# Full rollout after validation
eas update --branch production --rollout 100%
```

#### 5.3 Monitoring and Validation

**Post-Deployment Monitoring:**
- Error rates return to baseline
- Performance metrics improve
- User reports decrease
- No new related issues

**Success Criteria:**
- Incident metrics return to normal
- User complaints stop
- Functionality fully restored
- No regression in other areas

### Phase 6: Recovery and Closure (2-24 hours)

#### 6.1 Service Recovery
- Gradually re-enable disabled features
- Remove emergency workarounds
- Restore normal operations
- Verify all systems healthy

#### 6.2 User Communication
```
âœ… Issue Resolved: The [issue description] has been fixed. 
All functionality is now restored.

Resolution: [Brief description of fix]
Prevention: [Steps taken to prevent recurrence]

Thank you for your patience. If you continue to experience 
issues, please contact support.
