### 2. Production Build Deployment

**Trigger:** Merge to main branch or manual workflow dispatch

**Pre-deployment Steps:**
1. **Create Release Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b release/v1.x.x
   ```

2. **Update Version Numbers**
   ```bash
   # Update package.json version
   npm version patch|minor|major
   
   # Update app.json version and build numbers
   # iOS: increment buildNumber
   # Android: increment versionCode
   ```

3. **Final Testing**
   ```bash
   cd packages/mobile
   npm run test:all
   npm run type-check
   npm run lint
   ```

**Deployment Steps:**

1. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   # iOS Production Build
   eas build --platform ios --profile production-ios --non-interactive --auto-submit
   
   # Android Production Build
   eas build --platform android --profile production-android --non-interactive --auto-submit
   ```

2. **Monitor Build Progress**
   - Check EAS Build dashboard
   - Monitor build logs for errors
   - Verify signing and provisioning

3. **Post-Build Verification**
   - [ ] Build artifacts generated successfully
   - [ ] App size within acceptable limits
   - [ ] No critical warnings in build logs
   - [ ] Signing certificates applied correctly

### 3. Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates

**When to Use OTA:**
- Bug fixes that don't require native code changes
- Content updates and configuration changes
- Feature flag updates
- Non-critical improvements

**Deployment Steps:**
```bash
cd packages/mobile

# For staging/preview
eas update --branch preview --message "Bug fix: [description]"

# For production (after testing)
eas update --branch production --message "Production update: [description]"
```

**OTA Update Checklist:**
- [ ] Changes are JavaScript-only (no native dependencies)
- [ ] Update tested in preview environment
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Update message is descriptive
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

### 4. App Store Submission

**iOS App Store (Automatic via EAS Submit):**
1. Build automatically submitted to App Store Connect
2. Monitor submission status in App Store Connect
3. Respond to any review feedback
4. Release to App Store once approved

**Google Play Store (Automatic via EAS Submit):**
1. Build automatically uploaded to Google Play Console
2. Monitor review status in Play Console
3. Configure release rollout percentage
4. Monitor crash reports and user feedback

**Manual Submission (if needed):**
```bash
# iOS
eas submit --platform ios --latest

# Android
eas submit --platform android --latest
```
