# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for rebuilding the Teacher Hub mobile application from scratch using modern React Native architecture with New Architecture (Fabric and TurboModules), Hermes engine, and TypeScript in strict mode. The mobile app is designed exclusively for teachers and visitors (no admin functionality) and will provide a comprehensive educational platform for Ugandan teachers to collaborate, share resources, communicate, and access government educational content. The app prioritizes performance, offline functionality, accessibility, and user experience while maintaining security and reliability standards.
